The README on this repository has the commands for serving locally. This project is entirely open source and we welcome all contributions to the project.

Additionally if you are using the library for your projects please let us know by opening an [GitHub issue](https://github.com/NCSU-Libraries/iiif-annotation/issues). We are interested in any and all projects using this library. The "In the Wild" table lists projects currently using this library. We will not list your project here without your permission.

Because the library uses [W3 Web Annotations](https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/) and OpenAnnotations the library will work with a number of other annotation creation softwares. A list of known platforms are listed in the "Compatible platforms" table. Please open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/NCSU-Libraries/iiif-annotation/issues) if you believe your platform is compatible.
