# Annona

Annona is a JavaScript library that allows users to display W3 Web Annotations in a visual format. The tool comes with 4 options for displaying materials. The views listed below allow users to provide customizable teaching, learning and visualization tools that are usable across all devices.

* Image Viewer: this a simple view that shows the porition of the annotated image, and the corresponding text of that annotation. 
* Storyboard Viewer: this is a more dynamic view that provides the entire image in an OpenSeadragon viewer (zoomable, movable image viewer) along with displaying the annotations on the entire image view.
* Multi Storyboard Viewer: provides the same interface as the Storyboard viewer but allows for the comparison of multiple images and annotations next to each other.
* Range Storyboard Viewer: provides the same interface as the Storyboard viewer but allows users to tab through multiple different images. It is compability with IIIF manifests.
